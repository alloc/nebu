# Example plugins

This directory contains practical plugin examples to learn from.

If you have a unique plugin example, please submit a pull request!

If your plugin example _should_ work, but implementation bugs are blocking it, please submit a pull request! I will merge it (if you wish) once it works as expected (ie: the bugs get fixed). Your example will be useful while working on fixes. Otherwise, you can just submit a test case for each bug you're running into.
